Areas before Liurnia: Chapel of Anticipation; Cave of Knowledge - After Soldier of Godrick; Cave of Knowledge
Other areas are not necessary to get there.

This spoiler log lists all accessible areas in order from earliest to latest.
For each area, it lists ways to enter the area, from earliest to latest.
Paired warps are only listed once, under the entrance list of whichever area is later.

How to get to an area:
- Find the area name in the list below.
- The first indented line below the area name will show the earliest available way to enter it.
- Repeat this process, going backwards in the list until you find an area you've already visited.

If you're stuck in general, a good strategy is to find the first major boss arena which
you haven't visited yet and see how to get there. Bosses are marked with <<<<<
